                                <h2 style="color:white;">Dear Christies,</h2> <br>
								<p> School of Sciences at CHRIST University has created a niche in the realm of higher education in India through its programmes.
								It offers undergraduate, postgraduate, doctoral, and post-doctoral programmes in the disciplines of Chemistry, Physics & Electronics,
								Mathematics, Life Sciences, and Computer Science & Statistics. Research and publication, even at the undergraduate level, are an integral
								part of these programmes. The consistent top rankings of many of these programmes by different agencies stand testimony for our credentials.
								A number of research projects funded by agencies like UGC, DST, ISRO, SERB, NCBS, KSTA, etc have been carried out by our dedicated faculty
								members. A dedicated research block with all the latest research facilities boosts the morale of the faculty and research scholars alike.
								This is an ideal place for students with a research bent of mind to explore his/her passion.
								Apart from academics, students are molded holistically through various co-curricular and extracurricular activities. As the Dean,
								School of Sciences, I am proud to hold my team in high esteem and invite students and faculties to join my team to take it to newer heights.<br>

								prescient School of Commerce, Finance and Accountancy that it represents today, is credited to the commitment of several who grew with us.
								Over these years, as steward of an updated and relevant curriculum, and quality infrastructure, we have not just encouraged and supported
								the innovative efforts of our stakeholders to distill the prevailing global challenges and opportunities shaping our lives, but also
								educate students on how best to advance intellectual knowledge, and impact society for the better.<br>

                                <p>Welcome to the School of Arts and Humanities!You are twice blessed!! Firstly, for having successfully secured a place at CHRIST University,
								a pioneer in the field of liberal education in the country; secondly, for choosing Arts and Humanities stream for furthering your educational aspirations.
								I’m sure, right now you feel quite elated about your choices. In due course you would feel proud too, for having chosen this road to travel by.  For here,
								in an environment of autonomy and inclusivity you will learn to read and interpret the world from multiple perspectives; you will develop your abilities to
								think critically and independently. Your exposure to the breadth, diversity and creativity of human experience will transform you into better human beings
								and responsible citizens. The courses and people you engage with will spur you to have deeper reflections of your responsibilities to your own self and to
								those around you in a society where the local, national and global needs often converge. In the process your vision of / for the world will expand. In a spirit
								of openness and cooperation you will learn to appreciate the value and relevance of harmonious coexistence.<br>

                                <p>School of Law, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), through its five-year law Program, has carved a space for itself in the top league of premier
								law schools in India. The school molds its students through a combination of exposure to the advanced syllabus, clinical legal education programs,
								and faculty monitored participation in curricular and extra-curricular activities. The syllabus for the five-year program goes far beyond the basic
								requirements of the Bar Council of India reflecting the current trends and demands of academia and the industry. Besides having a league of highly
								qualified faculty, the educational process is supported by a library equipped with a rich depository of online and offline resources. The commitment
								to excel is evident in the challenging yet smooth transition to the online mode of education in the wake of the adversities thrown up by the pandemic.
								The School of Law will strive to work with an untiring commitment to the cause of rule of law and promotion of excellence in the realm of legal education in India.<br>
